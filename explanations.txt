For task 3.1. we did changes in the following files:

1)---
CMakeLists.txt
- initially the cmake file requested OpenCV 4.0 version, although installed correctly there was problem in the proper linking
- issue solved by changing:

=>from=>
...
# OpenCV package
find_package(OpenCV 4.0 REQUIRED core highgui imgproc imgcodecs PATHS "$ENV{OPENCVDIR}/build")
...

=> to => 
...
# OpenCV package
find_package(OpenCV 3.4 REQUIRED core highgui imgproc imgcodecs PATHS "$ENV{OPENCVDIR}/build")
...

2)---
include/types.h
- comment out //#define ENABLE_BSP, in order to do the first task only

3)---
src/timer.h
- to prevent a warning change the types of the time in the print message from %lld to %ld

4)---
main.cpp
- fix the path to the file

5)--
Scene.cpp
- most important changes described in the comments
